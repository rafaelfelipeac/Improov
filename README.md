Improov is a app that will help you achieve your goals.

By choosing to add a goal to the app and not keep it lost in thought, you will have an easier time viewing the steps necessary to achieve it.

Created with ❤️ to study topics related to Android such as Kotlin, MVVM, Coroutines, Jetpack (Room, ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation) and Dagger2.
